#Matrixify

##What's Matrixify:
Matrixify is a **Sublime text 2 plugin** that facilitates formatting lines of code into matrix shape.

If you dealt with a code with large data sets inside an array, list or a map like Hex data or countries list for example.
Then it's interesting to format it into a matrix shape , that's much elegant than a single line or element per line approach and make the code readable and compact.

##How to use it:
To use Matrixify you need to follow the steps:

* Choose lines that would be formated.
* Above the lines you have to write a format line (described below).
* Select the lines and use one of these three methods:
    1. From menu **Edit > Matrixify**.
    2. Keyboard shortcut **Ctrl+Alt+X** or **Ctrl+Super+X** on Mac (Change the key binding in case of conflict).
    3. The command **Matrixify** from the command palette.

You can also use multiple selections but every region must have it's own format line.

##Writing the format line:
A format line specify the position of each line with the character "%" and separators that will separates columns of the matrix.

**P.S:** The number of "%" used in the format line indicates the number of columns in the matrix.
